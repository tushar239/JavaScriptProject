    ng stands for angular
    ng-app is a one of the directive given by angularjs. when angular js sees this directive, it bootstraps itself (initializes itself and starts managing the page).

    You keep only one ng-app in a page. it will start applying angularjs from the dom where you put ng-app.
    So, if you put ng-app on some div, then angularjs won't work anywhere outside that div.
